# Dictionary-Game
This project is a C# Windows Forms application called “NDP_SozlukSinavi”, developed for the Object-Oriented Programming course. It is designed as a dictionary/vocabulary exam system, where users can practice and test their knowledge of English words from various sources such as TOEFL and YÖKDİL exam word lists.

The application includes multiple forms (Form1, Form2) for managing the quiz flow (starting tests, showing words, checking answers, and displaying results).

Vocabulary lists are stored in external .txt files (TOEFL, YÖKDİL Science, YÖKDİL Social Sciences) and loaded into the program.

The project applies OOP concepts in C#, along with event-driven programming using Windows Forms.

It is structured as a Visual Studio solution targeting .NET 8.0 for Windows.

 In short, this project helps students both practice English vocabulary for academic exams and gain programming experience with Windows desktop applications.
